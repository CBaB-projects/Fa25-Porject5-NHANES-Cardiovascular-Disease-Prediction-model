# Fa25-Porject5-NHANES-Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-model
The NHANES dataset contains rich health, lifestyle, lab, and biomarker information from a large, diverse U.S. population. This project aims to build a reproducible pipeline that leverages NHANES data to develop and benchmark machine learning models for CVD risk prediction, with an interactive dashboard for exploring key risk factors.
